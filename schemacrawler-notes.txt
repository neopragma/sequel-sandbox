This command line will let schemacrawler connect, but then it gets additional exceptions. Will have to plow through the exceptions one by one and figure out how to use the tool. It will be very tedious.

schemacrawler -database=db/testdb.sqlite3 -server=sqlite -c=brief -loglevel=CONFIG -i=standard -host=localhost
